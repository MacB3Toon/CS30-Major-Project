# Major project proposal

## Project description
Create a version of the FRUIT NINJA game where you can slice different types of fruit!

## Needs to have list
- Different fruits for the user to slice
- An effect when the fruit is cut open
- Max number of times that a fruit can drop off the screen before game over
- Opening start page
- Game over page with options on what to do next
- Functioning gravity
- Background music
- Sound effects
- A blade visible on the screen when the mouse is dragged

## Nice to have list
- Different blades to choose from
- The fruits would rotate as they go across the screen 
- Fruits would get chopped open on the angle that they were cut at 
- Special fruits that would have an effect on the game (ex: slow motion, no bombs)
- The ability to always have the blade out when you choose an option, not need to press down on the mouse constantly
- Fruit splatter would be based on what angle the fruit was cut at
- Combos
- High score function 
- When you hit a bomb and the game ends there's an effect of it exploding and making the screen dark
